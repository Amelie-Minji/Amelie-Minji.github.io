<!--I am currently a robotics engineer at Samsung Electronics and I am going to join Georgia Institute of Technology starting from Fall 2023. 
I envision a world where robots interact with people everywhere, assiting them and saving their lives. 
To that end, my research span lies broadly on robot control, optimization, and learning, especially for robotic tasks involving contacts.--> 
 Welcome! I am constructing my website. 

 I was a research engineer at Samsung Electronics and I am going to join Georgia Institute of Technology as a Ph.D. candidate starting from Fall 2023. 
 
 Please visit me again after Sep. 2023, when I will finish filling up this page!
